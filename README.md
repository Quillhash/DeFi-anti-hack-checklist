# DeFi-anti-hack-checklist

As DeFi protocols advance, so do the security issues associated with them. The cost of attacking DeFi protocols has also made it clear that DeFi security needs to be emphasized. So, we have made anti-hack checklists for projects, which will help them build and develop secure DeFi applications.

If you find anything missing or want to update existing resources, you can create a pull request and contribute to the project.

## Developing Stage

- [ ]  Always use the latest version of Solidity/ Rust or any other smart contract language.
- [ ]  Always hire experienced DeFi developers.
- [ ]  Full unit test coverage.
- [ ]  Proper architecture, design, and threat modelling.
- [ ]  Focus on designing a secure code.
- [ ]  Do thorough code documentation.
- [ ]  Make your application modular if possible.
- [ ]  Follow well-known programming practices.
- [ ]  Log all crucial operations.
- [ ]  Use the latest and well-tested libraries.
- [ ]  Stop Using Single Source as Price Oracle
- [ ]  Avoid known pitfalls and common vulnerabilities like SWC.
- [ ]  Access Control Protection for critical operations.
- [ ]  Design secure Tokenomics for Application.
- [ ]  Use Automated anomaly detection tools.
- [ ]  Technical due diligence
- [ ]  Perform formal verification for ensuring the correctness of contracts.
- [ ]  Perform external smart contract audits before deploying

## After Deployment:

- [ ]  Safeguard your wallet. It is recommended to use hardware wallets and multi-sig.
- [ ]  Do Periodic Audits
- [ ]  Host a bug bounty program
- [ ]  Insurances
- [ ]  On-Chain Monitoring
- [ ]  Have a disaster recovery plan for uncertainties
- [ ]  Maintain Proof of Reserves to safeguard user funds
- [ ]  Ensuring high-level transparency to the community
- [ ]  Community Support - Ensure that your interactions are only through official channels.
- [ ]  Register at Rating institutions likeÂ [blockchain-security contacts](https://github.com/crytic/blockchain-security-contacts). It helps others to contact you if a security flaw is discovered.
- [ ]  Keeping Your Tools and Devices Up to Date
- [ ]  Enable authentication methods/ 2FA to prevent Social account hacks.
- [ ]  Update yourself with the latest trends and hacks and also with DeFi technologies.

In a field like blockchain, which is continually growing, the saying "security is a journey and not a destination" reminds us that we should never stop learning.
